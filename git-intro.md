# Git Intro
# What is Git, and how is it different from other version control systems?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and allows multiple developers to collaborate. Unlike centralized systems, Git allows users to work offline, provides branching and merging capabilities, and maintains a full copy of the repository locally.

# Stages in Git
Untracked: Files not yet added to Git.
Tracked: Files already added, being monitored for changes.
Modified: Tracked files with changes.
Staged: Modified files added to the staging area, ready for commit.

# .gitignore
The .gitignore file tells Git which files or folders to ignore and not track in the repository. This is useful for excluding temporary, sensitive, or unnecessary files like logs or environment configs.
